	<p>
	  <strong>
		  Why did you create this app?
		</strong>
		<br>
		We're fathers just like you who wanted a space for dads to connect and share
		what we go through on the daily. There's so much to build and we're just
		getting started!
	</p>
	<p>
	  <strong>
		  How do I make a post?
		</strong>
		<br>
		Go to the "üè† Home" page and at the top you'll see a light gray section with
		a default question shown. Underneath it is a big input field &mdash;
		type what you want to post and then hit the "Share" button.
	</p>
	<p>
	  <strong>
		  How do I reply to comments made by other dads?
		</strong>
		<br>
		Whenever anyone makes a comment, you'll see an input field with the
		placeholder text of "Reply to NAME", where NAME is who made the comment.
		Type what you want to share and hit the enter key.
	</p>
	<p>
	  <strong>
		  How do I answer the Question of the Day?
		</strong>
		<br>
		Go to the "üè† Home" page and at the top you'll see a light gray section with
		a default question shown. Underneath it is a link which says "Question of
		the Day". Click it and the question of the day will appear. Type what you
		want to post and then hit the "Share" button.
	</p>
	<p>
	  <strong>
		  How do I invite other dads to join?
		</strong>
		<br>
		Go to the "Invites" page where you'll see your referral code. Give this code
		to your dad friends and have them visit thedaddyapp.com. They'll need it to
		sign up because right now access is limited and only invite-only.
	</p>
	<p>
	  <strong>
		  What do you do with my data?
		</strong>
		<br>
		For starters, we keep it safe and do not and will not ever sell it to
		anyone. More specifically,
		<ul>
		  <li>The comments you make will be visibile to other dads</li>
		  <li>
			  If your reach out and directly email hello@thedaddyapp.com, our
				correspondance remains private.
			</li>
			<li>
			  If you later on want to delete your account and have already made
				comments, suggested new features, replied to some other dads, etc,
				your name will be displayed as "Anonymous" and your account and personal
				data will be removed from our database.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
	  <strong>
		  Can I delete my account?
		</strong>
		<br>
		We'd hate to see you go, but yes you can. As of now, just shoot us an email
		at hello@thedaddyapp.com to let us know you want to be removed and we'll
		take care of the rest. It'll be like your personal data never existed on
		this site.
	</p>
	<p>
	  <strong>
		  Do you have any swag for sale?
		</strong>
		<br>
		Not yet, but soon! We have some thoughts on what to sell, but let us know
		what kind of swag you'd want either on the "Features" page or directly
		through email at hello@thedaddyapp.com.
	</p>
	<p>
	  <strong>
		  How can I get involved and help The Daddy App?
		</strong>
		<br>
		Hit us up at hello@thedaddyapp.com! Let us know how you'd like to get
		involved and we'll take it from there.
	</p>
	<p>
	  <strong>
		  What's the "üö® Report" feature for?
		</strong>
		<br>
		If someone's comment goes against our Community Guidelines, hit this button
		to let us know it deserves some attention. Each report will be handled
		on a case-by-case basis. Thanks, in advance, for keeping this a "good vibes
		only" kind of space.
