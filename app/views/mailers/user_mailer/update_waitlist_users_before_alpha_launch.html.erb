      Even with a due date, you never really know when your little one will
      arrive. And when they do, you might still wonder if you're ready
      even though the nursery is set, clothes are washed, car seat is
      installed, etc 😰.

      We've been there too, and now with The Daddy App, it feels like there's
      so much to do, but we know it's time to go live with what we've got.
      We wanted to launch by the end of January and with more
      features than it has at the moment. We completed the main feature though
      &mdash; enabling dads to chop it up &mdash; so with feature "A" done, we
      excitedly look forward to implementing “B” through "Z" and then some to
      help dads connect and grow 💪🏾.

      TLDR: the very first release of The Daddy App is only days away!!
      Don't forget: we'll also announce the winners of the first Monthly Raffle
      🎁.

      In the meantime, invite the dads you know to join the conversation on
      thedaddyapp.com 👥.

    <p>
      Hit us up if you have any questions, comments, or concerns &mdash; it'd be
      great to hear from you 🗣.

      All the best,
